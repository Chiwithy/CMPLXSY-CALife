## Conway's Game of Life

This model is a basic model based off the John Horton Conway's **Game of Life**, created in 1970. A cell color of **black** is denoted as a **live cell**, while a cell color of **white** denotes a **dead cell**. For each cell, it's **Moore neighborhood** is taken into account in determining its next state according to the rules. The game's rules are as follows:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
